# TravelManagement

This is a simple project where the system maintains the inventory data of the customers who wants to travel from one place to another.
If a customer is getting registered, he would receive a unique code, his personal details would be asked; and details of the acceptance code would be shown for the same. 
Notice the data file handling. We can modify the code to add another field of destination of place or make more entries into the data file as well. 
We can make the use of search based on selected fields. The details are cumulative stored in a text file. 
Search using just one parameter giving multiple results based on necessity.  
Travel Management System is the web application to automate all kinds of operations such as viewing travelling/ personal details, computing bill, editing and formatting the text file based on the same. 
The purpose of this software is to manage the travelling details of people.
